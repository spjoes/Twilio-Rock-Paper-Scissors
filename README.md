# Rock Paper Scissors over Twilio
Ever wanted to play rock paper scissors over a landline telephone? Of course you did! And now you can! Just call 1-833-513-2263 today!
Note: if you hear a busy signal that means one of 2 things:

1) You arent on the list of approved callers (this is because I dont want a huge Twilio bill)
2) My code is offline..... I didnt want to pay for server hosting....


# Why?
Because I wanted to play Rock paper scissors in a 1980s house. Why else?

# How?
Twilio provided the number and API. I just wrote Javascript to handle backend stuff and everything else

# I am Mr.Twilio and I want to give you $10000 for this idea
Oh my! Well thank you Mr.Twilio. I will take all your money, please dm me.
